## Wegood4u: Project Feature Summary
Wegood4u is a membership portal designed to connect bloggers and content creators with F&B and tourism businesses. The platform gamifies the process of visiting partner locations, allowing members to earn rewards while helping businesses increase their visibility.

## 1. User Authentication & Roles
The app will have a clear role-based system to manage user permissions.

Standard Registration: Users can sign up and log in using standard authentication methods.

Role Progression: Users progress through distinct roles:

- Subscriber: Default role after register. 

- Member: After completing membership verification. Members can participate in the core activities.

- Affiliate Member: A Member who has been approved by an admin and granted a unique invitation code. This role unlocks the affiliate system features.

Admin: A privileged user who manages the approval workflow and the affiliate system.

## 2. Proof of Visit & Approval Workflow
This is the core activity loop for members to engage with partner stores.

Submission: A Member uploads proof of their visit to a partner store, consisting of a selfie and a receipt picture.

Admin Review: Each submission is sent to a queue for manual review by an Admin.

Approval/Rejection: The Admin can either approve the submission, which counts towards the member's rewards, or reject it.

## 3. Badge & Reward System
A gamified system to reward active members for their approved visits.

Achievement Milestones: Members earn badges by reaching specific milestones (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40 approved visits).

Badge Categories: Rewards are categorized based on the type of partner store visited:

- Activity Badges: For total visits to any partner store.

- Cafe Badges: For visits specifically to partner cafes.

- Restaurant Badges: For visits specifically to partner restaurants.

Visual Achievements: Each badge is represented by a unique image that will be displayed on the member's profile to showcase their accomplishments.

## 4. Affiliate & Referral System
This system is designed to drive user growth through member invitations.

Becoming an Affiliate: A Member can request to become an affiliate. An Admin reviews this request, and upon approval, manually creates a unique invitation code (e.g., edbert1008) and promotes the user to the Affiliate Member role.

Two-Level Referral Tracking: The system tracks referrals two levels deep, allowing an Affiliate Member to view:

- Direct Referrals (Level 1): The list of users who signed up directly using their invitation code.

- Indirect Referrals (Level 2): The list of users who were invited by their direct referrals.
